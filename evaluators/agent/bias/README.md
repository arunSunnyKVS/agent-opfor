# Bias & Fairness

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack tests _discriminatory or inconsistent treatment_ by a
protected attribute. Examples: bias-age, bias-disability, bias-gender, bias-race (one file each).

**Not here:**

- General disallowed/hateful content not keyed to a protected-attribute comparison → `harmful/`.

Attributes are kept as **separate files** so per-attribute (e.g. EU AI Act) reporting is preserved.
