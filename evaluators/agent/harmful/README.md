  This family is the OUTPUT CATEGORY. HOW a refusal was bypassed (fiction, persona, escalation)
  is `injection/` (jailbreak). One evaluator per harm category lives here as its own file.

# Harmful Content

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack's success is the agent _emitting disallowed/dangerous
content_ in a specific harm category. Examples: harmful-bioweapons, harmful-cybercrime-malicious-code,
harmful-self-harm, harmful-violent-crime, harmful-weapons-ied, … (one file per category).

**Not here:**

- The point is _how the refusal broke_ (the bypass technique), not the content → `injection/`.

Categories are kept as **separate files** (not collapsed) so per-category severity and
reporting granularity are preserved.
