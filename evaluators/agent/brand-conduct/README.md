name: Brand & Conduct
surface: agent
description: >-
  The agent acts against the business it represents — making binding commitments it has no
  authority for, endorsing/steering to competitors, impersonating a human or another brand,
  or abandoning its stated purpose and drifting off-topic. Commercial/brand harm, not dangerous content.
boundary: >-
  This family is OFF-POLICY / OFF-BRAND / OUT-OF-SCOPE behaviour. Dangerous content is `harmful/`;
  safety-guardrail bypass is `injection/`; fabrication is `accuracy/`.

# Brand & Conduct

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack pushes the agent _off-policy, off-brand, or out of
scope_. Examples: imitation, competitors, contracts, off-topic.

**Not here:**

- The output is dangerous/disallowed content → `harmful/`.
- The mechanism is a guardrail bypass → `injection/`.
