name: Excessive Agency
surface: agent
description: >-
  The agent is induced to use its tools/actions in unauthorized, destructive, or out-of-scope
  ways — performing privileged or irreversible operations, or chaining actions it should refuse —
  because the LLM's tool-call decision flows into the action without confirmation or scope limits.
boundary: >-
  This family is OVER-PERMISSION / UNGATED ACTION. Crossing a specific user or privilege boundary
  (acting as another user, escalating role) is `access-control/`. An action whose harm is reaching
  a code/SQL/shell sink is `code-execution/`. Pure data leakage with no action is `disclosure/`.

# Excessive Agency

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack makes the agent _take an action beyond its remit_ —
ungated, destructive, or out-of-scope tool use. Examples: excessive-agency, tool-misuse.

**Not here:**

- The failure is _who_ the action was performed for / privilege escalation → `access-control/`.
- The action's payload reaches a _code/SQL/shell sink_ → `code-execution/`.
