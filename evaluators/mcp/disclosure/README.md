  The MCP server exposes information it should protect — hardcoded secrets/credentials, raw
  errors/stack traces, data from other resources or tenants (cross-resource leakage), or
  over-broad resource exposure.
boundary: >-
  This family is DATA EXPOSED by the server. Exposure that required an auth bypass is `auth/`;
  a poisoned tool return is `tool-poisoning/`.

# Information Disclosure

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack makes _the MCP server expose protected data_.
Examples: secret-exposure, cross-resource-leakage, resource-exposure.

**Not here:**

- The exposure required an auth bypass → `auth/`.
