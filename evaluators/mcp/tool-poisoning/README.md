  This family is the SERVER emitting poisoned tool descriptions/results. The agent-side question
  of whether a client trusts such poison is `evaluators/agent/mcp-usage/`.

# Tool Poisoning

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack concerns _poisoned MCP tool descriptions, schemas, or
return values_ served by the MCP server. Examples: tool-description-injection,
tool-description-scan, content-injection, return-value-injection.

**Not here:**

- Whether an **agent client** trusts a poisoned tool → `evaluators/agent/mcp-usage/`.
