# Rogue Agents Evaluator

## What It Tests

Rogue Agents (ASI10) includes:

- Compromised agents appearing legitimate
- Agents with hidden malicious instructions
- Agent impersonation
- Undetected deviation from intended behavior

## Why It Matters

- **Complete trust violation**: Legitimate-looking agent is malicious
- **Undetected compromise**: Rogue agent operates for extended period
- **High impact**: Compromised agent with legitimate access = full compromise
