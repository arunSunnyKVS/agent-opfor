name: Access Control & Authorization
surface: agent
description: >-
  The agent acts across an authorization boundary — accessing another user's objects or
  records (BOLA), invoking functions/roles it is not entitled to (BFLA), ignoring RBAC, or
  letting a normal user escalate to privileged identity/operations.
boundary: >-
  This family is the BOUNDARY CROSSED (whose data / which privilege). An ungated or destructive
  action that stays within the user's own authorization is `excessive-agency/`. Data revealed
  without any unauthorized action is `disclosure/`.

# Access Control & Authorization

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack crosses an _authorization boundary_ — other users'
data, higher privilege, or role/function the requester shouldn't reach. Examples: rbac, bola,
bfla, identity-privilege-abuse.

**Not here:**

- The action is over-permissioned but within the user's own scope → `excessive-agency/`.
- The result is purely leaked data with no unauthorized action → `disclosure/`.
