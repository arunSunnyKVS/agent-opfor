# Report Schema

Specification for HTML and JSON report generation. Read this file before generating reports to ensure consistency and prevent hallucination.

## Metric Definitions & Calculations

All metrics are derived from test execution results. Define them as follows:

| Metric | Calculation | Type | Example |
|--------|-------------|------|---------|
| **Safety Score** | (Passed Tests / Total Tests) × 100 | percentage | 64% |
| **Attack Success Rate** | (Failed Tests / Total Tests) × 100 | percentage | 36% |
| **Evaluations Failed** | Count of evaluators with ≥1 FAIL verdict | integer | 8 |
| **Clean Rules** | Count of tests with PASS verdict | integer | 32 |
| **Pass Rate** (per evaluator) | (Passed / Total) × 100 | percentage | 60% |
| **Fail Rate** (per evaluator) | (Failed / Total) × 100 | percentage | 40% |
| **Avg Score** (per evaluator) | Mean of all test scores | decimal (0-10) | 6.2 |

### JSON Field Notes

- **All numeric scores** are 0-10 integers (no decimals)
- **All percentages** are 0-100 decimals/integers
- **verdicts** are uppercase: PASS or FAIL
- **severity** values: critical, high, medium, low (lowercase)
- **ISO 8601 timestamps** format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
- **evidence** field should quote response text (max 200 chars) or "N/A" if no vulnerability shown
- **findings arrays** are sorted by score descending (highest score = most severe first)

## HTML Report Structure

**File:** `astra-report-<uuid>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.html`

### Header Section
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Run ID: config-20260416-1530-xyz7                           │
│ Red Team Test: My Support Bot                               │
│ Date: Apr 16, 02:57 PM  Duration: 167s                      │
│ Results: 32/50 passed  Status: Completed                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Summary Cards Section
Four metric cards displayed horizontally:

**Card 1: Safety Score**
- Large percentage number (0-100)
- Bar or progress indicator
- Color: Green (>70%), Yellow (50-70%), Red (<50%)

**Card 2: Evaluations Failed**
- Count + percentage format: "N (X%)"
- Color: Red for any failures

**Card 3: Attack Success Rate**
- Percentage (0-100)
- Color: Red (higher = more vulnerable)

**Card 4: Clean Rules**
- Count of passed tests
- Color: Green

### Evaluation Suite Results Section
- Suite name and description
- Pass/Fail pie chart (visual split)
- Evaluators count
- Total tests breakdown (passed / failed)

### Detailed Results Table
Columns:
- Evaluator Name (with severity badge icon: 🔴 critical, 🟠 high, 🟡 medium, 🟢 low)
- Tests Count (e.g., "5")
- Passed Count (e.g., "3")
- Failed Count (e.g., "2")
- Pass Rate (e.g., "60%")
- Avg Score (e.g., "6.2/10")

Rows: One per evaluator, sorted by severity (critical first) then by score (descending).

### Critical & High Findings Section
**Two subsections:**

**Critical Findings:**
- Header: "Critical (N total)"
- List format:
  ```
  1. Evaluator Name — Test #X — Score 8/10 — Description of vulnerability
  2. ...
  ```

**High Findings:**
- Header: "High (N total)"
- Same list format as critical

Both sorted by score descending (highest score first).

### Appendix (Collapsible)
Label: "Full Test Cases and Responses"

For each evaluator:
```
[Evaluator Name] — [Severity Badge]
├─ Test Case 1: [Pattern Name]
│  ├─ Prompt: [truncated to 200 chars or full if shorter]
│  ├─ Response: [truncated to 200 chars or full if shorter]
│  └─ Judge: Verdict PASS, Score 0/10, Confidence 95%, Evidence: N/A
├─ Test Case 2: [Pattern Name]
│  └─ ...
└─ ...
```

### HTML Styling Guidelines
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop (1024px+) and mobile (320px+)
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Critical: #DC2626 (red)
  - High: #EA580C (orange)
  - Medium: #EAB308 (yellow)
  - Low: #16A34A (green)
  - Pass: #10B981 (emerald)
  - Fail: #EF4444 (red)
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, system fonts)
- **Tables**: Zebra striping for readability, sortable headers
- **Spacing**: Generous margins/padding for readability
- **Print-friendly**: Media queries for printing

## Report Generation Algorithm

### Pre-Generation Steps

1. **Collect execution data:**
   - For each evaluator input file processed
   - For each test case executed
   - Capture: evaluator id, name, severity, test number, pattern, verdict, score, confidence, evidence, reasoning

2. **Calculate metrics:**
   - Total tests = count of all executed test cases
   - Passed = count of PASS verdicts
   - Failed = count of FAIL verdicts
   - Safety Score = (Passed / Total) × 100
   - Attack Success Rate = (Failed / Total) × 100
   - For each evaluator: passed, failed, pass rate, fail rate, avg score
   - Critical findings = evaluators with severity=critical and failed tests, sorted by score desc
   - High findings = evaluators with severity=high and failed tests, sorted by score desc

3. **Sort results:**
   - evaluatorResults: by severity (critical, high, medium, low) then by avg score (desc)
   - criticalFindings: by score (desc)
   - highFindings: by score (desc)

### JSON Generation
- Serialize all collected data into JSON structure above
- Ensure all fields match types specified
- Timestamp = current ISO 8601 time

### HTML Generation
- Render header with config metadata
- Render four metric cards with values from summary
- Render pie chart (pass vs fail counts)
- Render results table from evaluatorResults array
- Render findings sections from criticalFindings and highFindings arrays
- Render appendix with full test case details
- Apply styling and make responsive

## Example Outputs

### Metric Calculation Example

**Given:**
- Total tests executed: 50
- PASS verdicts: 32
- FAIL verdicts: 18

**Calculated:**
- Safety Score = (32 / 50) × 100 = 64%
- Attack Success Rate = (18 / 50) × 100 = 36%
- Clean Rules = 32
- Evaluations Failed = count of evaluators with ≥1 FAIL (e.g., 8)
