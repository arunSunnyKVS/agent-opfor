  Configure a target for AI red team assessment. Use when the user wants to
  set up a new target, configure what to test, or create a astra.config.md.
  Trigger when they say "configure", "set up", "create config", or start a

# Red Team Configuration

Configure a target for red team assessment. Collect the following from the user interactively.

## 1. Target Information

Ask the user about their target:
- **Name** — what do they call it? (e.g., "Support Bot")
- **Type** — what kind of system? (`chatbot`, `api`, `agent`, `rag-pipeline`)
- **Endpoint** — how to reach it? (URL, `local`, or a description)
- **Model** — what model powers it, if known? (optional)

## 2. Target Type

Ask the user which integration method they want to use. Discover available options by scanning `../red-team-run/targets/` for `.md` files. Default to `http-endpoint`.

## 3. Auto-Detect Application Context (Optional)

Before asking the user, try to auto-detect context from existing documentation and code in the current repo.

**Capabilities vary by environment:**

### With filesystem access (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, local agents):

Full code repo scanning available:

1. **Markdown documentation** (highest priority):
   - `Agents.md` — architecture and design docs
   - `README.md` — project overview
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design
   - `docs/`, `docs/system-prompt.md` — system prompt docs

2. **Code scanning** (if no markdown docs found):
   - System prompts in comments (e.g., `// SYSTEM_PROMPT:`, `<!-- SYSTEM PROMPT -->`)
   - Configuration files (`.env`, `config.json`, `config.yaml`)
   - Constants and docstrings defining purpose, scope, permissions
   - Comments explaining sensitive data handling
   - Risk/security sections in code comments
   - Environment variables and their meanings

3. **File structure analysis**:
   - Endpoint patterns (for API targets)
   - Package names and descriptions
   - Database models (to infer sensitive data)
   - Permission/role definitions

### Without filesystem access (web Claude, API-only agents, etc.):

Limited to what the user has already shared in the conversation:
- Documentation they've pasted into chat
- Code snippets they've shown
- System prompts they've described
- Context from previous messages

**Graceful degradation:**
If no auto-detectable information is found (regardless of environment), the skill simply falls back to asking the user interactively.

**Extract information about:**
- What the system does (purpose, scope)
- User types and access levels
- Types of sensitive data handled
- Critical or dangerous operations
- Forbidden topics or constraints
- System prompt (if documented or found in code)

**Confirmation Flow:**
If auto-detection found any information (from docs or code), present it as prefilled:

```
🔍 I scanned your repo and found documentation.

Pre-filled Application Context:
  Purpose:        [extracted from Agents.md line 5]
  User Types:     [extracted from README.md line 23]
  Sensitive Data: [extracted from code comments]
  Dangerous Ops:  [extracted from config]
  Forbidden:      [extracted from README.md]
  System Prompt:  [extracted from system-prompt.md]

✅ Looks good, use this?
📝 Edit these fields?
❌ Start fresh (ignore auto-detected data)?
```

**User must explicitly confirm** before proceeding. If they choose to edit, show each field with the auto-detected value highlighted so they can modify.

**Only ask from scratch if:**
- No documentation or code was found, OR
- User explicitly chose "Start fresh"

---

## 4. Application Context (Confirmation & Refinement)

Understanding the target's purpose and constraints helps evaluators craft more effective, targeted attacks.

**If auto-detection was successful:**

Present the pre-filled fields and require explicit confirmation:

```
✓ Found pre-filled data from your documentation:

  1. What does this agent do?
     [auto-detected: "Customer support chatbot for e-commerce"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  2. Types of users who interact with it
     [auto-detected: "logged-in customers, guest users"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  3. Types of sensitive data it handles
     [auto-detected: "order history, payment methods, addresses"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  4. Critical or dangerous actions
     [auto-detected: "process refunds, delete accounts"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  5. Topics it should never discuss
     [auto-detected: "competitor pricing, internal financials"]
     Edit? (y/n)
```

For each field, the user can:
- **`y` (yes, edit)** — Show a text input pre-populated with the auto-detected value
- **`n` (no, skip)** — Keep the auto-detected value and move to next field
- **`?` (help)** — Show examples and explanation

**If auto-detection found nothing:**

Ask the user for each field from scratch:

- **What does this agent do?** — Primary purpose and scope of the system (e.g., "customer support for e-commerce", "internal research assistant")
- **Types of users who interact with it** — User categories and their access levels (e.g., "logged-in customers, guest users, support agents with elevated access")
- **Types of sensitive data it handles** — What data the system processes (e.g., "order history, payment methods, personal addresses, medical records")
- **Critical or dangerous actions it can perform** — High-risk operations (e.g., "process refunds, delete accounts, authorize expenses")
- **Topics it should never discuss** — Forbidden subjects and restricted information (e.g., "competitor pricing, internal financials, unreleased products")

**Citation (for transparency):**

When using auto-detected data, include a comment in the generated config showing where it came from:

```markdown
## Application Context

### What does this agent do?
Customer support chatbot for e-commerce
<!-- Auto-detected from Agents.md:5 -->

### Types of users who interact with it
logged-in customers, guest users
<!-- Auto-detected from README.md:23 -->
```

*Note: This is optional but dramatically improves attack quality. Evaluators use this context to craft white-box attacks that specifically target the guardrails and scope boundaries the user defines.*

## 5. System Prompt (if available)

Ask the user if they can share the target's system prompt. This is optional but extremely valuable — evaluators can craft attacks that specifically target the guardrails and constraints defined in the system prompt.

## 6. Assessment Scope: Suite or Custom Evaluators

Ask the user how they want to define what to test:

### Option A: Use a Suite

Discover available suites by scanning `../red-team-run/suites/` for `.md` files and reading the `name` frontmatter from each. Present them with descriptions.

If user chooses a suite, confirm which evaluators it covers.

### Option B: Custom Evaluator Selection

Discover available evaluators by scanning `../red-team-run/evaluators/` for `.md` files and reading the `name`, `severity`, and `description` frontmatter from each. Present them grouped by severity.

Ask user to select which evaluators to run. Multiple selections allowed.

## 7. Depth (if applicable)

Ask:
- **basic** — quick scan with basic-level attacks only
- **intermediate** — moderate difficulty attacks testing defense mechanisms
- **advanced** — advanced attack patterns attempting to bypass defenses

## 8. Additional Notes

Ask the user for any additional context about the target that might help crafting attacks — specific concerns, known issues, business context, risk tolerance, etc. This free-form context helps generate smarter, more targeted attacks.

## 9. Write Config

Write the config to `.astra/configs/<name>.md` (where `<name>` is derived from the target name, lowercase with hyphens). A fully-filled example is at `../../astra.config.md.example` for reference.

The config format:

```markdown
# Red Team Configuration

## Target Information

**Name:** <user input>
**Type:** <user selection (chatbot, api, agent, rag-pipeline)>
**Target Type:** <user selection from adapters (http-endpoint, custom-function)>
**Endpoint:** <user input (URL, localhost, or description)>
**Model:** <user input or "unknown">

## Application Context

### What does this agent do?
<user's description of purpose and scope>

### Types of users who interact with it
<user's list of user types and access levels>

### Types of sensitive data it handles
<user's list of data types>

### Critical or dangerous actions it can perform
<user's list of risky operations>

### Topics it should never discuss
<user's list of forbidden subjects>

## System Prompt

<user's system prompt if provided, else "Not provided">

## Test Configuration

**Mode:** suite | custom
**Suite:** <selected suite name (if Mode=suite)>
**Evaluators:** <comma-separated list (if Mode=custom)>
**Depth:** basic | intermediate | advanced

## Notes

<user's free-form context and concerns>

<!--
Config ID: <generated ID>
Created: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
-->
```

**If a config already exists for this target**, ask the user if they want to:
- Overwrite the existing config
- Create a separate config with a different name (e.g., `.astra/configs/chatbot-v2.md`)
- Exit without saving

## 10. Confirm

Show the user a summary:
- Target: <name> (<type>)
- Assessment: <suite or custom evaluators> at <depth> level
- Config saved to: `.astra/configs/<filename>`
- Next step: `npx astra run --config .astra/configs/<filename>`

Suggest they can also:
- View/edit the config at `.astra/configs/<filename>`
- Store multiple configs in the `.astra/configs/` folder
- See examples at `.astra/configs/README.md`
