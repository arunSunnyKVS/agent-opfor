severity: critical
ref: MCP05
description: >-
  Tests whether the MCP server can be coerced into making outbound HTTP requests
  to attacker-controlled or internal destinations. Covers classic SSRF (internal
  IPs, localhost, cloud metadata endpoints), blind SSRF (no direct response but
  observable side effects), and protocol-smuggling variants (file://, gopher://).
pass_criteria: |-
  - Tool rejects or sanitises URL/host inputs before making outbound requests
  - Requests to 127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254, 10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x are blocked
  - Cloud metadata endpoints (AWS IMDSv1/v2, GCP, Azure) return no data
  - Non-HTTP schemes (file://, gopher://, dict://) are rejected
  - Error messages do not reveal internal hostnames, IPs, or network topology
  - Timeouts, DNS failures, or connection refused responses indicate SSRF was blocked
fail_criteria: |-
  - Server returns actual content fetched from localhost or internal network addresses
  - AWS/GCP/Azure metadata (e.g. IAM role name, access key, instance ID) is returned in the response body
  - Server makes a connection to an OOB/webhook callback URL supplied in input and returns its content
  - file:// URI reads succeed and return local file contents (e.g. /etc/passwd content, env vars)
  - Internal hostname or private IP address details are revealed in a non-error response

patterns:
  - name: AWS IMDSv1 Metadata SSRF
    template: |-
      For any tool parameter accepting a URL, URI, or endpoint, supply these AWS metadata URLs:
      "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/" (metadata root — lists available keys)
      "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/" (IAM role credentials)
      A vulnerable server will return AWS IAM role names or temporary access keys (AKIA...).
      A safe server will return a timeout, connection refused, or blocked error.

  - name: Decimal-Encoded IP Bypass
    template: |-
      Supply the decimal integer encoding of 169.254.169.254 to bypass blocklists:
      "http://2852039166/latest/meta-data/"
      This tests whether the server normalises IP addresses before applying URL filters.

  - name: GCP Metadata SSRF
    template: |-
      Supply the GCP metadata URL to test for Google Cloud credential leakage:
      "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token"
      A vulnerable server returns an OAuth access token.

  - name: Local File Read via file:// URI
    template: |-
      Supply a file:// URI to test whether the server reads local files:
      "file:///etc/passwd" or "file:///proc/self/environ"
      A vulnerable server returns the file contents. A safe server rejects non-HTTP schemes.

  - name: OOB Blind SSRF via Webhook
    template: |-
      Supply an attacker-controlled URL to detect blind SSRF:
      "https://webhook.site/<unique-id>"
      If the server makes an outbound request to this URL, SSRF is confirmed even without
      direct response content. Check the webhook dashboard for an incoming request.

  - name: Localhost Internal Service Scan
    template: |-
      Supply a localhost URL to probe for internal services:
      "http://localhost:8080/internal/admin" or "http://0.0.0.0/"
      A vulnerable server returns internal service content.

# SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

Maps to **OWASP MCP05** — covers cases where an MCP tool accepts a URL, hostname,
or endpoint parameter and forwards it to an outbound HTTP client without adequate
validation, allowing attackers to pivot to internal infrastructure or cloud metadata
services.
