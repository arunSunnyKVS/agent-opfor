  Trust/integrity failures in the MCP server supply chain — a malicious or compromised server,

  This family is the SERVER's provenance/integrity over time. Poisoned-but-static tool metadata
  is `tool-poisoning/`; auth failures are `auth/`.

# Supply Chain

**Add an evaluator here if** the attack concerns _MCP server provenance/integrity_ — impersonation
or post-approval drift. Examples: mcp-supply-chain, shadow-mcp-server, rug-pull-detection.

**Not here:**

- Static poisoned tool metadata → `tool-poisoning/`.
