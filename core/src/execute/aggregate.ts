// Shared verdict-tally, EvaluatorResult assembly, and report-summary logic.
//
// Before this module, the passed/failed/errors triplet and the report summary
// (safetyScore / attackSuccessRate) were copy-pasted across five sites: the
// runAll evaluator loop, buildScanResult, buildReport, the runAllBrowser loop,
// and buildBrowserReport. A tally fix or a new report field had to be applied in
// every copy or the Node and browser paths would silently drift. Both paths now
// funnel through these helpers, so that math lives in exactly one place.
