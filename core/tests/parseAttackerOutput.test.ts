/**
 * Unit tests for parseAttackerOutput.
 *
 * Covers the tag-parser added in the Crescendo attacker rewrite — extracts
 * [TECHNIQUE: …] and [LAST_REPLY_HOOK: …] from the first ~3 lines of the
 * attacker LLM's output, strips them from the body, tolerates code-fence
 * wrapping, and preserves the existing `[Attacker]:` prefix strip.
 *
 * Run with: npm test --workspace=core
