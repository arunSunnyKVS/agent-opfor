  Configure a target for an Astra security assessment. Use when the user wants to
  set up a new target, configure what to test, or create an astra.config file.
  Scan the repo first (including telemetry env and config) when the skill lives
  inside the user's project; only ask for missing pieces. Optionally use traces
  so attack prompts mirror real usage. Trigger when they say "configure", "set up",
  "create config", or start an Astra assessment for the first time without a config.

# Astra — target configuration

Configure a target for an Astra assessment. When this skill is **installed in the user’s repo**, prefer **reading that repo** (endpoints, `astra.config*`, env examples, telemetry) **before** a long questionnaire; then collect **only** what is still unknown.

## 1. Target Information

Ask the user about their target (or pre-fill from repo scan when obvious):
- **Name** — what do they call it? (e.g., "Support Bot")
- **Type** — what kind of system? (`chatbot`, `api`, `agent`, `rag-pipeline`)
- **Endpoint** — how to reach it? (URL, `local`, or a description)
- **Model** — what model powers it, if known? (optional)

## 2. Target Type

Ask the user which integration method they want to use. Discover available options by scanning `./targets/` for `.md` files. Default to `http-endpoint`.

## 3. Auto-Detect Application Context (Optional)

End users often **pull this skill into their own repo**. Treat that repo as the source of truth: **scan it first**, then **only ask for what you cannot infer** (and never ask anyone to paste **secret** API keys, tokens, or passwords into chat).

**Capabilities vary by environment:**

### With filesystem access (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, local agents):

Full code repo scanning available:

1. **Markdown documentation** (highest priority):
   - `Agents.md` — architecture and design docs
   - `README.md` — project overview
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design
   - `docs/`, `docs/system-prompt.md` — system prompt docs

2. **Code scanning** (if no markdown docs found):
   - System prompts in comments (e.g., `// SYSTEM_PROMPT:`, `<!-- SYSTEM PROMPT -->`)
   - Configuration files (`.env`, `config.json`, `config.yaml`)
   - Constants and docstrings defining purpose, scope, permissions
   - Comments explaining sensitive data handling
   - Risk/security sections in code comments
   - Environment variables and their meanings

3. **File structure analysis**:
   - Endpoint patterns (for API targets)
   - Package names and descriptions
   - Database models (to infer sensitive data)
   - Permission/role definitions

4. **Telemetry and observability (scan before asking the user)**  
   Assume the project may already export traces (Langfuse, Netra, OpenTelemetry, Sentry, etc.). **Discover; do not interrogate** unless something is ambiguous or missing.

   **Where to look:**
   - `astra.config.json`, `astra.config.yml`, `astra.config.yaml` — any `telemetry` block (provider, Langfuse/Netra options, propagation config, trace list limits, etc.)
   - `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.example`, `docker-compose*.yml`, Helm charts, Terraform, `.github/workflows/*` — variable **names** such as `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`, `NETRA_API_KEY`, `NETRA_BASE_URL`, `OTEL_*`, `SENTRY_*` (read examples for docs; avoid echoing real secret values into the transcript)
   - `package.json` / lockfiles — packages like `@langfuse/tracing`, `langfuse`, `netra-sdk`, OpenTelemetry SDKs
   - Application code — imports and init of Langfuse/Netra/OTEL, middleware that sets trace or correlation headers, exporters, `trace.getActiveSpan`, `startActiveSpan`
   - Service READMEs or runbooks mentioning observability dashboards or trace IDs

   **What to extract (for later config / attack grounding):**
   - Which observability product appears in use (if any): `"langfuse"`, `"netra"`, or `"none"`
   - Base URL or which **env var name** holds the API origin (not the secret value)
   - Which **env var names** hold credentials (never ask the user to type secrets into chat; instruct them to set vars locally or in CI)
   - Whether the target accepts a `trace_id` field in request body (or similar propagation field) — if so, note the field name for `propagation.traceIdBodyField`. If no such field exists in the target's request schema, note this: tell the user that judge enrichment from traces won't work unless they add trace ID propagation to their agent (reading the injected field and forwarding it to the telemetry SDK as the active OTel trace ID)
   - Any Astra-specific limits already in `astra.config` (`listLimit`, `listMaxPages`, trace summary size caps, etc.)

### Without filesystem access (web Claude, API-only agents, etc.):

Limited to what the user has already shared in the conversation:
- Documentation they've pasted into chat
- Code snippets they've shown
- System prompts they've described
- Context from previous messages
- If they mention Langfuse/telemetry, ask for **redacted** config snippets or env **names** only — not live secrets

**Graceful degradation:**
If no auto-detectable information is found (regardless of environment), the skill simply falls back to asking the user interactively.

**Extract information about:**
- What the system does (purpose, scope)
- User types and access levels
- Types of sensitive data handled
- Critical or dangerous operations
- Forbidden topics or constraints
- System prompt (if documented or found in code)
- **Telemetry**: provider, how auth is wired (env var names), trace propagation hints (from repo scan above)

**Confirmation Flow:**
If auto-detection found any information (from docs or code), present it as prefilled:

```
🔍 I scanned your repo and found documentation.

Pre-filled Application Context:
  Purpose:        [extracted from Agents.md line 5]
  User Types:     [extracted from README.md line 23]
  Sensitive Data: [extracted from code comments]
  Dangerous Ops:  [extracted from config]
  Forbidden:      [extracted from README.md]
  System Prompt:  [extracted from system-prompt.md]

Pre-filled Telemetry (from repo — no secret values shown):
  Observability:    [detected provider, e.g. "langfuse" or "netra" — from astra.config + package.json]
  API origin:       [env var name holding the base URL, e.g. LANGFUSE_BASE_URL or NETRA_BASE_URL]
  Auth:             [env var name(s) holding credentials — set locally, not pasted here]
  Trace injection:  [body field name to inject per request, e.g. "trace_id" — omit if target doesn't support it]

✅ Looks good, use this?
📝 Edit these fields?
❌ Start fresh (ignore auto-detected data)?
```

**User must explicitly confirm** before proceeding. If they choose to edit, show each field with the auto-detected value highlighted so they can modify.

**Only ask from scratch if:**
- No documentation or code was found, OR
- User explicitly chose "Start fresh"

**Only ask extra telemetry questions when:**
- Nothing observability-related was found in the repo, OR
- Multiple stacks conflict (e.g. two different trace vendors), OR
- The user wants a different setup than detected, OR
- Required env vars are **missing** on their machine — tell them **which names** to set, not to paste secrets

---

### Trace-backed attack prompts

Real traces from production tell you how users actually talk to the agent — their vocabulary, goals, and the edge cases the agent already encounters. Use them to ground attack prompts in realistic scenarios rather than generic templates.

**If the repo ships the `astra` CLI** (`astra setup --config …`): prefer telling the user to run that once. It handles trace listing, curation, and writes `tracedata.json` + `trace-summary.md` automatically. Then read `trace-summary.md` when generating attack inputs in Step 9.

**If running skills-only (no CLI)** and a telemetry provider is discoverable with credentials available in the user’s environment:

1. **Fetch traces** via the provider’s HTTP API. Prefer small, diverse samples — not full production dumps.
   - **Langfuse**: `GET /api/public/traces` with Basic auth (public key + secret key from env)
   - **Netra**: `POST /sdk/traces` with `x-api-key` header (`NETRA_API_KEY` from env), body `{ startTime, endTime, pagination: { limit: 20 } }`
2. **Summarize** for your own use — extract these signals specifically:
   - **User vocabulary and goals**: how real users phrase requests, what tasks they attempt, what they call things
   - **Topics the agent engages with vs refuses**: where the boundary is, what phrasing triggers refusals
   - **Tool calls and data access**: what external systems the agent queries, what fields it retrieves, what parameters it passes
   - **Over-explanation in refusals**: does the agent name internal fields, policy versions, or system notes when refusing? (leaks attack surface)
   - **Conversation flow patterns**: does the agent’s guard relax after initial identity verification? Are there topic progressions that lower its defenses?
   - **Edge cases and errors**: unusual inputs that caused unexpected behavior, span errors, fallback responses
   Keep the summary dense; avoid dumping raw PII.
3. When **writing attack prompts** in Step 9, ground each one in that summary: use real user vocabulary, target the specific data fields and tools the traces reveal, exploit the behavioral patterns and boundary edges you observed — not generic template fills.

**If no telemetry is available**: generate attacks from evaluator `patterns` templates alone, adapted to the application context collected in Steps 3–5.

## 4. Application Context (Confirmation & Refinement)

Understanding the target's purpose and constraints helps evaluators craft more effective, targeted attacks.

**If auto-detection was successful:**

Present the pre-filled fields and require explicit confirmation:

```
✓ Found pre-filled data from your documentation:

  1. What does this agent do?
     [auto-detected: "Customer support chatbot for e-commerce"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  2. Types of users who interact with it
     [auto-detected: "logged-in customers, guest users"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  3. Types of sensitive data it handles
     [auto-detected: "order history, payment methods, addresses"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  4. Critical or dangerous actions
     [auto-detected: "process refunds, delete accounts"]
     Edit? (y/n)

  5. Topics it should never discuss
     [auto-detected: "competitor pricing, internal financials"]
     Edit? (y/n)
```

For each field, the user can:
- **`y` (yes, edit)** — Show a text input pre-populated with the auto-detected value
- **`n` (no, skip)** — Keep the auto-detected value and move to next field
- **`?` (help)** — Show examples and explanation

**If auto-detection found nothing:**

Ask the user for each field from scratch:

- **What does this agent do?** — Primary purpose and scope of the system (e.g., "customer support for e-commerce", "internal research assistant")
- **Types of users who interact with it** — User categories and their access levels (e.g., "logged-in customers, guest users, support agents with elevated access")
- **Types of sensitive data it handles** — What data the system processes (e.g., "order history, payment methods, personal addresses, medical records")
- **Critical or dangerous actions it can perform** — High-risk operations (e.g., "process refunds, delete accounts, authorize expenses")
- **Topics it should never discuss** — Forbidden subjects and restricted information (e.g., "competitor pricing, internal financials, unreleased products")

**Citation (for transparency):**

When using auto-detected data, include a comment in the generated config showing where it came from:

```markdown
## Application Context

### What does this agent do?
Customer support chatbot for e-commerce
<!-- Auto-detected from Agents.md:5 -->

### Types of users who interact with it
logged-in customers, guest users
<!-- Auto-detected from README.md:23 -->
```

*Note: This is optional but dramatically improves attack quality. Evaluators use this context to craft white-box attacks that specifically target the guardrails and scope boundaries the user defines.*

## 5. System Prompt (if available)

Ask the user if they can share the target's system prompt. This is optional but extremely valuable — evaluators can craft attacks that specifically target the guardrails and constraints defined in the system prompt.

## 6. Assessment Scope: Suite or Custom Evaluators

### Step 1: Discover Available Suites

**Before asking the user anything**, scan `./suites/` for all `.md` files:

For each file, read the **YAML frontmatter** (between the first pair of `---` lines) and extract:
- `id` — stable suite id (e.g. `owasp-llm-top10`; must match the filename stem)
- `name` — display name
- `version` — optional label (e.g. `"2025"`)
- `description` — short summary for the user
- `evaluators` — ordered list of evaluator ids (strings) that belong to this suite

Example suites found:
```
📋 owasp-llm-top10
   OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025)
   Tests: prompt injection, sensitive disclosure, supply chain vulnerabilities, etc.

📋 owasp-agentic-ai
   OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 (2024)
   Tests: goal hijacking, tool misuse, identity abuse, cascading failures, etc.
```

### Step 2: Discover Available Evaluators

**Also scan** `./evaluators/` for all `.md` files:

For each file, read the **YAML frontmatter** and extract:
- `id` — evaluator ID (e.g., "prompt-injection")
- `name` — display name (e.g., "Prompt Injection")
- `severity` — critical, high, medium, low
- `owasp` — mapping label (e.g. LLM01, ASI03)
- `description` — what it tests
- `patterns` — array of `{ name, template }` used to generate attacks (same source the CLI reads)
- `pass_criteria` / `fail_criteria` — strings used when judging (may be multi-line)

The markdown **body** (headings like "What It Tests", "Why It Matters") is for humans; **do not** invent alternate templates in the body — use `patterns` from frontmatter when generating inputs.

Group evaluators by severity for display.

### Step 3: Ask User to Choose

Present EXACTLY TWO options (no "Other", no custom suite names):

```
How would you like to define what to test?

A) Use a predefined suite (faster, standard coverage)
   1. owasp-llm-top10 — OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications
   2. owasp-agentic-ai — OWASP Agentic AI Top 10

B) Custom selection (pick specific evaluators)
```

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Only present suites that actually exist in `./suites/`
- Do NOT allow free-form suite names
- If user chooses A, ask them to select from the discovered suites
- If user chooses B, present discovered evaluators grouped by severity

### If User Chooses Option A: Suite

Ask:
```
Which suite would you like to run?
1. owasp-llm-top10
2. owasp-agentic-ai
```

After they choose, show which evaluators will run:
```
✓ You selected: owasp-llm-top10

This will run these 10 evaluators:
- Prompt Injection (critical)
- Sensitive Information Disclosure (critical)
- System Prompt Leakage (critical)
- ... (7 more)
```

### If User Chooses Option B: Custom Evaluators

Present evaluators grouped by severity (discovered from `./evaluators/`):

```
CRITICAL (5 found):
  ☐ Prompt Injection
  ☐ Sensitive Information Disclosure
  ☐ System Prompt Leakage
  ☐ Agent Goal Hijacking
  ☐ Tool Misuse and Exploitation

HIGH (10 found):
  ☐ Excessive Agency
  ☐ Data and Model Poisoning
  ☐ ... (8 more)

MEDIUM/LOW: ...

Select evaluators to run: (comma-separated or checkboxes)
```

Allow multiple selections. Show count of selected evaluators.

## 7. Test Case Count

Ask: **"How many attack variations per evaluator would you like to generate?"**

Offer options:
- **3** — quick, focused (basic patterns only)
- **5** — default, balanced (recommended)
- **10** — comprehensive, in-depth
- **Custom** — let user enter any number 1-20

Record as `**Test Cases:** <n>` in config.md.

---

## 8. Turn Mode

Ask: **"Single-turn or multi-turn conversations?"**

Explain the difference:
- **Single-turn** — each test is one prompt → one response (faster, simpler)
- **Multi-turn** — each test is a conversation with 2–5 turns, where each turn escalates in exploitation intensity (more realistic, finds more subtle bypasses)

Record as `**Turn Mode:** single | multi` in config.md.

---

## 9. Generate Attack Inputs

After collecting test configuration, generate pre-attack input files automatically.

**For each selected evaluator:**

1. Read the evaluator file from `./evaluators/<evaluator-id>.md`
2. Parse YAML frontmatter: use the `patterns` array (`name` + `template` strings) as the only source of attack templates
3. Generate `<test_cases>` attack prompts:
   - Use those templates
   - Adapt to target using:
     - Target name, type, endpoint, model
     - System prompt (if provided)
     - Application Context (purpose, user types, data, actions, forbidden topics)
     - **Trace summary** — if `trace-summary.md` exists (from `astra setup`) or you fetched/summarized traces above, use it to make prompts realistic: mirror real user vocabulary, exploit behavior patterns observed in traces, target edges the traces reveal
     - Notes
   - For **single-turn**: each test case is one standalone prompt
   - For **multi-turn**: each test case is a conversation sequence (Turn 1 → initial attack, Turn 2 → escalation, Turn 3+ → further exploitation)
4. Copy pass/fail guidance from frontmatter `pass_criteria` and `fail_criteria` (or the `## Evaluation Criteria` section in the body if you need extra context for the report)
5. Write to input file (see "Write Config Folder" step for format)

Show progress bar:
```
Generating inputs...
  Prompt Injection (5 cases)      ✓
  Sensitive Disclosure (5 cases)  ✓
  Jailbreaking (5 cases)          ✓
  ... (remaining evaluators)
```

---

## 10. Write Config Folder

Generate a UUID-based folder name: `config-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXXX` (where XXXX is 4 random alphanumeric chars).

Create folder structure:
```
.astra/configs/<uuid>/
  config.md
  inputs/
    prompt-injection.md
    jailbreaking.md
    ... (one file per evaluator)
```

**Write `config.md`:**

```markdown
# Red Team Configuration

## Target Information

**Name:** <user input>
**Type:** <user selection (chatbot, api, agent, rag-pipeline)>
**Target Type:** <user selection from adapters (http-endpoint, custom-function)>
